Week 5 Quiz


Suppose you derived a classification model. The performance you obtained on the training set and the test set are both poor (large error). Check all that apply.
[x]The model suffers from high-bias.
[ ]The model overfits the data.
[x]Adding more complex features may help derive a better model.


Multiple Choice
10/10 points (graded)
The in-sample error (error of a learning algorithm on the training set) is typically lower than the out-sample error on a test set.
[x]True correct
[ ]False
 

Multiple Choice
We can get multiple local optima if we perform a linear regression by minimizing the mean square error.
[ ]True 
[x]False correct
 

Multiple Choice
10/10 points (graded)
With K-NN, one can represent only linear decision boundaries.
[ ]True
[x]False correct
 

 
Multiple Choice
10/10 points (graded)
If the performance of a classification model on the test set is poor, you can just re-calibrate your model parameters to achieve a better model.
[ ]True
[x]False correct
 

 
Multiple Choice
10/10 points (graded)
The examples in a validation set are used to train the classification model.
[ ]True
[x]False correct
 

Multiple Choice
10/10 points (graded)
To learn a regression model you can either use gradient descent or normal equation.
[x]True correct
[ ]False
 

 
Multiple Choice
10/10 points (graded)
Because it is straightforward to calculate in just one step, using normal equation is the preferred method when the feature space is large (e.g., 10,000 features).
[ ]True
[x]False correct
 

 
Multiple Choice
0/10 points (graded)
If the learning rate Î± is small enough, gradient descent converges very quickly.


[ ]True incorrect
[x]False correct

What is the difference between classification and regression? Check all that apply.
[ ]Classification requires labeled data, while regression requires unlabeled data.
[ ]Classification has numerical values as labels while regression has categorical (discrete) labels.
[x]Regression has numerical values as labels while classification has categorical (discrete) labels.
